# Research Workspace

This directory is the minimal paper workspace for TIM.

## Purpose

- Keep paper-facing artifacts under version control.
- Tie claims to the implemented architecture rather than to speculative extensions.
- Separate research assets from user-facing API/reference documentation.

## Current assets

- [Paper Outline](paper-outline.md)
- [Paper Source](tim-paper.md)
- [System Diagram](../design/system-diagram.md)
- [Architecture Reference](../design/architecture.md)
- Final PDF artifact: `output/pdf/tim-paper.pdf`

## Writing discipline

- Treat the schema-driven extension model as the core claim.
- Keep terminology aligned with the codebase: schema, template, parser, validator, dispatcher, executor.
- Mark any forward-looking claims as future work until backed by code or measurements.

## Suggested next artifacts

- A short related-work note on agent tool schemas, execution gateways, and intent systems.
- A reproducible evaluation note with the exact experiments used in the paper.
- Figure exports derived from the Mermaid system diagram.
